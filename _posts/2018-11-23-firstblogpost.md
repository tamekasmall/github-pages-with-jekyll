Sometimes just getting to the start line is half the journey done.  I wouldn't say this journey is as easy, but certainly easier once I made the decision to take a side step from Yoga in to coding.

### Gong fu
I graduated in mechanical engineering and worked as a building services engineer for a few years, before falling in love with martial arts and moving to China for three years.  Besides having the time of my life, I taught English, study Mandarin and even ended up on TV competed for [The Amazing Race - China Rush](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Amazing_Race:_China_Rush_2).  

### Balance
Coming back to London I dipped my toes in teaching physics and maths, before getting spotted and became a UK Nike Trainer.  Working as a fitness trainer for over 7 years gave be a greater appreciation for balance and wellness, which lead me into **yoga**.  

### Coding
And now, I lovingly jumping back into the world of data, numbers and logic. I love it ! Learning code merges all the things I love in life (well, not all of them :wink),  **creativity**, **numbers + data** and creating just amazing stuff!

Thanks for stopping by. Hope you enjoy following my journey.
